### I. Instructions on how to interact with the work
    1. Move the mouse slowly over the screen, and you can see the dove is following your cursor. 
    2. Click wherever you want on the screen, and you will see the explosion of feathers. Afterwards, I would like to make all the feathers(tris) floating on the screen.
    3. After you second click, the pieces will recompose a dove again where your cursor is at.

### II. Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
###### 1. my chosen method: interaction
    To better showcase the theme and binary contrast of the war and peace, life and death, as well as imply how fragile the dove is, but still it is gonna be if given enough time to recover.

###### 2. Which properties of the image will be animated and how?
    The dove class will be animated. Here are methods used:
    1.Create a crosshair that move with the cursor.
    2.Create class dove and draw doves that are flying from the left side of the screen to the right side.
    3.Make a explosion effect while clicking, add a new list that stores data about particles and make each of them smaller and more transparent with time. When they become totally transparent, remove them from the list.
    4.After the explosion, leave a anti-war icon on the back ground.

###### 3. Group decision:
    There's no other group member in my group, so I choose user input because I believe this method would display my inspiration in the best way.
###### 4. References to inspiration for animating your individual code

###### 5. A short technical explanation of how your individual code works to animate the image and any appropriate references.
    Overally speaking, my individual work is about three parts. The steps are already stated. I would list methods used which were not taught in class here and explain them in short language:
    
    beginShape() and endShape();
    vertex(x,y);
    .splice(i, j);
    
    







*If you made a lot of changes to the group code, explain it here.
*If you use tools and technique from outside the course, explain why you used them and how they work.
*If you copy a technique from the Internet, explain how it works, why you used it, and where it came from.
